# rsutil

Collection of Rust utility libraries, some more useful than others.

- [`iter-debug`](./iter-debug/): debugging iterators like arrays.
- [`miny`](./miny/)\*:  `Box<T>` with small `T`'s stored inline.
- [`punch-card`](./punch-card)\*: punched card literals, for some reason.

\* = requires nightly rust to compile
